## Description
 This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. The link below lists the password special characters identified from the OMASP Foundation:

## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data<br/>
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria<br/>
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security<br/>


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password<br/>
WHEN I click the button to generate a password<br/>
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria<br/>
WHEN prompted for password criteria<br/>
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password<br/>
WHEN prompted for the length of the password<br/>
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters<br/>
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password<br/>
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters<br/>
WHEN I answer each prompt<br/>
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected<br/>
WHEN all prompts are answered<br/>
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria<br/>
WHEN the password is generated<br/>
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page<br/>

## Installation

I used the VS Code software to edit code, git to pull the starter code to my local machine and git to push changes to GitHub along the way until I reach my final version.

## Usage

Here's a link to my website stored in GitHub:

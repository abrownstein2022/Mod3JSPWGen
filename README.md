## Description
 This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. The link below lists the password special characters identified from the OMASP Foundation:

## Installation

We used the VS Code software to edit code, git to pull the starter code to our local machines and then git again to push our final versions to GitHub.
